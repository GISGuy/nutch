# Planetary defense (PD) Web crawler
Most open source Web crawlers (e.g. Apache Nutch) deal with focused crawling by relying on a keyword or document list composed by subject matter experts and similarity measures such as cosine similarity and Na√Øve Bayes classifier. This work has extended Nutch by developing a semi-supervised method of creating keyword list and considering both text content and hyperlink structure in the Planetary Defense Framework Gateway project, a NASA funded effort aimed to develop a cyberinfrastructure for scientific collaboration across different organizations. Please refer to the slides [here](https://www.slideshare.net/YongyaoJiang/a-knowledge-discovery-framework-for-planetary-defense) for more detail.
